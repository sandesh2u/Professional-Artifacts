# Professional-Artifacts
A list of artifacts that I have authored so far or use as templates at various client organizations to build upon. 
Please note that these artifacts have been redacted for security reasons. Not to be considered as completed documents but instead used for reference on structure and presentation.

Here, you will find the following documents:
a. Sample - Business Requirement Document, this shows a general structure of a BRD and how well the details have been captured.
b. Sample - Data Dictionary, this document shows a way to capture all the Business definitions, metrics, logic along with reporting matrix in one place which can be validated with business.
c. Sample - Mockup deck 1, this provides one way of prototyping a future state business solution using powerpoint. With the help of this artifact, requirements can be visualized to help business make decisions on the functionality and use cases.
